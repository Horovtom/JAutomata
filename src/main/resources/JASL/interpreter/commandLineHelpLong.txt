This is help for the JASL Language. JASL is made to make work with JAutomata library easy and fast.
JASL works as any other scripting language and is most commonly used in interactive shell environment.
It's features include variables declarations, function calls and lists definition.

Syntax:
    Variable declarations:
        Variables start with '$' sign. After $, there could be any string without spaces.
            examples: $a, $alright, $let's, $doItMate26

    Assignment to variables:
        You can assign to variables with '=' sign. Just as you would in C or Java.
            examples: $a = hello, $b = $a

    Comments:
        Comments in JASL start with # sign. If # sign is the first character on a line,
        that line will not be parsed as a command.

Data types:
    Text:
        Anything that is not a command, list, variable name or function call is interpreted as text.
        It does not have to be enclosed in any type of quotes.
            examples: this is text

    Lists:
        Lists in JASL are simple to use. Just enclose comma-separated list of objects in curly braces '{}'.
        Every element of a list will be evaluated on assignment. Lists can be nested and they can have no elements.
            examples: {2, 3, 1}, {2, {1, 3}, 2}, {}, {$b, $c}
            note: Consider the following code:
                    $b = 2
                    $c = 3
                    $a = {$b, $c}
                  Because every element is evaluated on assignment, the contents of list $a will be: {2, 3}

    Automata:
        To declare Automaton of some type you have to specify its transition table in format of nested list.
        If you are creating ENFA automaton, you can signify epsilon column in the table as 'eps'.
            examples:
                Consider this automaton transition table:
                            a   b
                    >   0   1   2,3
                    >   1   -   1,4
                    <>  2   -   0
                    <   3   3   3
                        4   4   2

                This automaton has 4 states, It has three initial states and two accepting states.
                We will create this NFA automaton as such:
                    $alphabeth = {a, b}
                    $row1 = {>, 0, 1, {2,3}}
                    $row2 = {>, 1, {}, {1, 4}}
                    $row3 = {<>, 2, {}, 0}
                    $row4 = {<, 3, 3, 3}
                    $row5 = {4,4,2}
                    $automatonTable = {$alphabeth, $row1, $row2, $row3, $row4, $row5}
                    $automaton = Automaton($automatonTable)
        We have these member functions on automaton objects:
            equals(other):
                This will return boolean (true/false). It will be true if the two automatons accept the same language.

            reduce():
                This will return reduced automaton. This reduced automaton will be DFAAutomaton object.
                    example:
                        $dfaReduced = $nfa.reduce()

            accepts(word):
                This will return whether the automaton accepts specified word. Word can be either a string or an array of letters.
                    example:
                        $automaton.accepts(hello)
                        $automaton.accepts({h,e,l,l,o})

            toCSV(path):
                This will create file at specified path that will contain the automaton in .csv format separated by commas.
                    example:
                        $automaton.toCSV(/home/user/Documents/automaton.csv)

            toTikz(layout):
                This will return string containing TeX code to display the automaton diagram in TeX files.
                Includes needed for the code to work can be get by command: getTikzIncludes().
                Parameter layout is optional. If not specified, graphviz will use 'dot' layout.
                Layout can be one of these options: {neato, circo, dot}

            toPNG(path):
                This will create png image of this automaton at specified path.

            toTexTable():
                This will return string containing TeX code to display the automaton table in TeX files.

            toRegex():
                This will return string containing regular expression that describes the automaton.

            toDot(layout):
                This will return string containing dot code to display this automaton.
                Parameter layout is optional. If not specified, graphviz will use 'dot' layout.
                Layout can be one of these options: {neato, circo, dot}

            toSmipleDot():
                This will return pure dot code without the formatting to display this automaton.

            union(other):
                This will return automaton that accepts union of the languages accepted by the originals.

            intersection(other):
                This will return automaton that accepts intersection of the languages accepted by the originals.

            kleene():
                This will return automaton that accepts kleene of the language accepted by the original.

            concatenation(other):
                This will return automaton that accepts concatenation of the languages accepted by the originals.

            complement():
                This will return automaton that accepts complement of the language accepted by the original.

            renameState(oldName, newName):
                This will try to rename state of the automaton to the new name. It will fail if the old state
                has not been found or if the new state name is already occupied.

            renameLetter(oldName, newName):
                This will try to rename letter of the automaton to the new name. It will fail if the old letter
                has not been found or if the new letter name is already occupied.
Functions:
    We have these functions for general use:
        Automaton(table):
            This will return new Automaton object according to passed transition table.

        fromCSV(path):
            This will return Automaton object that has loaded from .csv file at path. This .csv has to be comma-separated.

        getExample():
            This will return NFAAutomaton that had been specified in the example of Automaton initialization

        fromRegex(regex):
            This will return Automaton that accepts the same language as regex specified in the argument.
            Epsilon in the regex should be signified as 'eps'
            example:
                $automaton = fromRegex(a*bba*(eps+b)*)

        getTikzIncludes():
            This will return string containing the includes lines needed for tikz code to work.
