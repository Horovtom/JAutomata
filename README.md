==========================

This repository contains the code for the JAutomata and JASL projects.

**JAutomata** library is a library that implements Deterministic Final Automata, Non-deterministic final automata and Non-deterministic final automata with epsilon transitions.

It implements conversion of regular expressions to automata and vice versa. It also implements reduction of automata.

**JASL** language is a new scripting language for operating the  JAutomata library.

**JASL Interpreter** is an interpreter for parsing and executing commands in JASL. It also implements live console environment for the user. The full user documentation can be found in [this document](https://github.com/Horovtom/BPP/blob/master/bpp.pdf)
