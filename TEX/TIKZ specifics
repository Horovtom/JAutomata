Seems like 0,0,12,16 is the maximum bb of a tikzpicture that is suitable for PDF A4 page.
It has problems with high numbers in coordinates, because of number precision in calculations. It will not compile, if the numbers are too high.
Not even scaling down the entire image will help. Hence we have to reduce the coordinates out of DOT code to suitable ranges:
0,0,12,16.
//TODO: If we have a lot of nodes, we might need to scale the nodes down to fit the page. Graphviz will not do that for us.
